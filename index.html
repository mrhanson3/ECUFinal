    		<h3>Origins of Yoga</h3>
    		<div class="yoga">
	    		
		    	<p>Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Among the most well-known types of yoga are Hatha yoga and R&amacr;ja yoga.</p>
		    	<p>The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is mentioned in the Rigveda, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE.<br/>(source:Wikipedia)</p>

		    	<p>The American College of Sports Medicine supports the integration of yoga into the exercise regimens of healthy individuals as long as properly-trained professionals deliver instruction. The College cites yoga's promotion of "profound mental, physical and spiritual awareness" and its benefits as a form of stretching, and as an enhancer of breath control and of core strength<br/>(source: Wikipedia)</p>

			<h3>Viny&amacr;sa</h3>
			<div class="viny">
    			
		    	<p>Viny&amacr;sais a Sanskrit term often employed in relation to certain styles of yoga, that usually refers to a transition between two different positions. Like many Sanskrit words, viny&amacr;sa has many meanings; nyasa denotes "to place" and vi denotes "in a special way". The term "Viny&amacr;sa" can also be used to reference a style of yoga practiced as one breath, tied to one movement.<br/>
